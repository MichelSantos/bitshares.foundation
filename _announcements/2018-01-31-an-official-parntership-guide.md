The BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) is pleased to see flourishing
growth of the BitShares Decentralized Autonomous Company (the *BitShares
DAC*).  The entire ecosystem enjoys following press releases announcing
3rd party businesses that work on (or with) BitShares and associated
tokens (e.g. BTS, bitCNY, bitUSD, etc.).

As an independent non-profit entity, the BBF would like to support
growth and sees official partnerships with BitShares as a blessing to
the entire crypto space. We would like to take the opportunity and
educate the wider audience about how an official partnership with
BitShares can be established and what limitations a partnership comes
with.

# The official partnership guide to BitShares

The following can be seen as a guide to reach official partnership by
the BitShares DAC.

1. **Prepare an application document**: To improve your application,
   the BBF recommends that you add sufficient information about your
   company that simplifies the due diligence procedure of
   individual BTS holders. Make sure that the goals of your project and
   the benefits to the BitShares DAC are clear and concise.
2. **Publish your application**: To ensure all required information is
   available at one place, the BBF recommends to place your application
   on the web for everyone's availability. Some BTS holders may require
   a trusted hosting platform that allows to track improvements made to
   your application during the application period.
3. **Register your application with the BitShares DAC in form of a 'worker'**:
   This step is crucial and not only notifies BTS holders about your
   application, but also allows them to officially approve it publicly.
4. **Engage the BTS token holders who vet your application to approve your application** - 
   After registration, be prepared to engage the BTS holders through
   different communication channels. Engaging the community can
   significantly improve your chances of being officially approved.
5. **Have your application approved by the majority**: This step is out
   of the hands of the applicant and merely depends on the scrutiny of
   the BTS holders. An application is approved once the corresponding
   proposal on the blockchain is approved sufficiently to be activated.

## Limitations

Obviously, a partnership can only be called *official* if it reached a
certain level of support through the BTS holders. Since the governance
process of the BitShares DAC allows voting and the change of previous
votes at any time with near immediate impact, anything that may have
been approved and stamped *official* at one point in time may as well
lose support by BTS holders at which point the partnership has to be
re-evaluated.

Furthermore, any partnership is limited to a specified mandate set forth
at the start of the approval voting process. Changes to the mandate may
result in the loss of support by BTS holders.

Last, but not least, the BitShares DAC, being Decentralized Autonomous
Company, cannot participate in legally binding contracting frameworks,
since no legal person (such as a CEO in regular companies) is authorized
to sign any contract.

# Prime example

The official approval of the [BitShares
Spokesperson](http://www.bitshares.foundation/spokesperson) by the
BitShares DAC is an excellent example for the applicability of this
guide. If required, the BBF gladly provides your business with further
consultation.
